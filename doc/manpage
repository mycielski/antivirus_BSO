.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]antivirus_BSO\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]antivirus_BSO\f[R] scans files and calculates their SHA256
checksums.
If a file\[cq]s digest matches one found in the hashes database (passed
as the first cli argument of the program) that file is flagged as
malicious and moved to quarantine.
Malicious files have their x permission unset.
You can exit the program while it is running by passing a SIGINT
(Ctrl+C).
It will exit gracefully.
.SH HASHING ALGORITHM
.PP
File digest is generated with the SHA 256 algorithm provided by OpenSSL.
The choice to use this algorithm comes from my experience with
VirusTotal, as it is the type of hash VT accepts for lookups.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\f[B]antivirus_BSO\f[R] does not take any options.
.SH BUGS
.PP
No known bugs.
.SH AUTHORS
Tomasz Mycielski.
